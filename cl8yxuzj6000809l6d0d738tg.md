For a very long time, I've been fascinated by the idea of starting a technical blog but I didn't have the courage to do it, I grew up as a bookworm, reading was and still is my favorite hobby, and becoming a writer was my first childhood dream (pretty nerdy I know). I've been thinking about it lately and I've decided that I don't need to start big, I just need to start regardless, So here I am.

This is my first Article in a weekly series in which I'll share stuff I've read, watched, and heard throughout the week and found interesting and worth sharing.

## Stuff I've Heard
 
[Discipline Now .. Freedom Later](Link)
- I've been into Stoicism lately and The Daily Stoic is one of my favorite podcasts out there, this episode talks about discipline and the importance of being disciplined in today's world.

- Quote from the episode:
> At a critical moment in The Odyssey, Odysseus tied himself to the mast of his ship because he knew he wouldn’t be able to resist steering the ship toward the beautiful sound of the Sirens. In temporarily giving up his freedom, Odysseus became the first person ever to hear the Sirens without fatally crashing into the rocks surrounding the island where they lived.
